# Image Style Transfer App

This repository contains the code for an Image Style Transfer application, which includes both a mobile app and a backend service for neural style transfer.

## Repository Structure

- `app/`: Contains the Android app frontend code
- `Deep-Learning-Image-Style-Transfer/`: Backend code for neural style transfer
  - `main.py`: Implements neural style transfer using VGG network
- `PhotoStylingApp.apk`: Installable Android app file

## Backend

The neural style transfer implementation is located in the `Deep-Learning-Image-Style-Transfer` folder. The main logic is in `main.py`, which uses a VGG network to perform style transfer on images.
